LuckyRoller is a fun, interactive web app designed to randomly select a winner from a list of players. Users can input names, emails, numbers, and phone numbers for each participant. Once validated and submitted, a single click on the “Roll” button triggers a fair, animated draw that picks one lucky winner and displays their details with a celebratory confetti effect. Ideal for games, giveaways, team-building activities, or classroom selections!
